# LCDnum_Detect
This project is about detecting LCD numbers(7-segment digital numbers).
Image Segmentation: Finding the contour of number area or Finding the color area of number
Detecting Method: Threading Method or KNN

Updating ... ...

## Requirements
* python3
* OpenCV4
* module "imutils"
* module "numpy"
* module "sklearn" (using KNN to detect may need this)

## Result Preview


## Introduction
"./LCDnumDetect_Color.py"
"./LCDnumDetect_Contour.py"
"./knn/LCDnumDetect_Color1.py"
"./knn/LCDnumDetect_Color2.py"

## Attentions
* The difficulty of this project lies in image segmentation and the methods which provide in this project may not the best way.
* In KNN method, using KNN functions of OpenCV has higher FPS than that of sklearn.
